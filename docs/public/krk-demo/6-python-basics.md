# Python Basics (variables, conditions, loops, lists, strings, functions, user interactions and file handling)

To get familiar with Python programming language during this week you need to go through some interactive tutorials.

We will refer to the particular sections of this tutorial like this: **Module [number] (module_name / relevant_lessons)** e.g.: you can read about python in **Module 1 (Basic concepts / 1).**

You can register for Sololearn with your google account. You can find the tutorial here (**you don't have to do all of them, just the sections we are referring to below!**): <https://www.sololearn.com/Course/Python/>

In addition to the above, we collected tutorials from different sources. These are here to help you understand different topics, so they are not mandatory if you are confident with your current knowledge. Keep the week's goal in mind and use these resources as you like. -> Try to do the assignments and use the tutorials as help.

## Basic variables, concept

Until now, we used expressions (like: 4 and 2+2 and "this is a string") to print something out. But if we want to reuse a value, we gonna need some variables and of course we would like to operate on them...

  * **Module 1 (Basic concepts)**



## Conditions

  * **Module 2 (Control structures / 1-4)**



## While Loops

  * **Module 2 (Control structures / 6)**
  * You can practice it more with doing the following exercises
    * <https://pythonbasics.org/while-loop/>



## Lists and Strings

  * **Module 2 (Control structures / 7-9)**
  * You can practice more by doing the following exercises as well:
    * <https://pythonbasics.org/list/>
    * <https://pythonbasics.org/strings/>



## For Loops

  * **Module 2 (Control structures / 11-12)**
  * You can practice more by doing the following exercises as well:
    * <https://pythonbasics.org/for-loops/>



## Copying of a variable

  * <http://www.python-course.eu/python3_deep_copy.php>



## Functions

  * **Module 3**
  * You can practice more by doing the following exercises as well
    * <https://pythonbasics.org/functions/>



## User interaction

  * <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html>
  * <https://pythonbasics.org/keyboard-input/>



## File handling

  * **Module 4**
  * You can read more about this topic in the following articles:
    * <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files>
    * <http://www.programiz.com/python-programming/file-operation>



You can watch this video which can help you to summarize the topics above in half an hour. Only the first 30 minutes is related to the introduced fields:
