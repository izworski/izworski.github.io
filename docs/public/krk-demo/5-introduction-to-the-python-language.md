# Introduction to the Python language

## What is Python?

**Python** is a widely used [high-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language "High-level programming language") , [general-purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language "General-purpose programming language"), [interpreted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_%28computing%29 "Interpreter \(computing\)"),[ dynamic programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language "Dynamic programming language").[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-34-23)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-24) Its design philosophy emphasizes code [readability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability "Readability"), and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer [lines of code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code "Source lines of code") that would be possible in languages such as [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++") or [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29 "Java \(programming language\)").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-Summerfield-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-26) The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-7-27)

## History of Python (optional)

(This is an optional section of the curriculum, no one will ask you about it)

You can read short articles about the language:

  * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Python>
  * <http://www.python-course.eu/python3_history_and_philosophy.php>



Also, you can hear the short version from the main author himself:

## Where to write the code?

There are 2 ways to run the Python [Interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_%28computing%29):

Using the interactive shell: <http://www.python-course.eu/python3_interactive.php>

Executing a script file: <http://www.python-course.eu/python3_execute_script.php>

(Please read, follow and try out both tutorials)

Note that we made an alias to **python3** as **python** during the installation of Ubuntu, so for you, Python 3.x is the default version.

## How to structure the code?

Since Python uses indentations to define code blocks, it is important to write readable (and compile ready) code. When the code is not understandable by the interpreter, we talk about a syntactical error.

Please read this section: <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#indentation>

and this answer: <https://docs.python.org/3/faq/design.html#why-does-python-use-indentation-for-grouping-of-statements>
