# What is this all about?

## The Curriculum system

We want to present you one of first steps we took to get rid of Canvas, as we had many serious issues with it. We hope you'll enjoy using this new system.

Any new updates will appear here, while the pages of Canvas will remain as read-only archives if you'd want to look for earlier materials.

When we will be ready, these pages will also be replaced by a restructured curriculum that fits better to the mastery-based approach we pursue here in Codecool.

## Features

One great feature here is the search bar at the top of the left sidebar. We hope it will make easier to find relevant materials.

We decided to use some emojis to represent type of content on the sidebar. Their meaning:

* if there is no icon, it is a regular content page
* :hammer: marks an assignment
* :heavy_plus_sign: marks any content that is not mandatory but might be useful for those who want to learn more
* :ballot_box_with_check: marks a quiz.

## Give feedback!

If you have any idea of changing anything on these pages, just contact us. We'll be glad to hear how we could improve them.
